						<p>Meta has refused to enter into new deals with Australian media publishers for the use of their content on Facebook, leading to fears it may again implement a ban on news content appearing on the platform. But an analysis of Facebook data suggests engagement with posts from news organisations is already at an all-time low, as memes fill the space.</p>

<p>Meta has argued that news makes up just 3% of what people engage with on its services.</p>

<p>An analysis by Guardian Australia has determined that this appears to be by design, with Meta turning off the tap for news in the past few years.</p>

<p>A study carried out in 2021 by researchers from the University of Technology Sydney and RMIT looked at the amount of engagement with Facebook posts by Australian news organisations over time.</p>

<p>It showed a decline in engagement between 2015 and November 2020, as well as a decline in traffic from Facebook to news websites.</p>

<p>Guardian Australia has updated this analysis, which shows that engagement with posts from Australian media is now at an all-time low, with the exception of the brief period in February 2021 when Facebook blocked news posts in Australia.</p>

<p>This drop in engagement and traffic was due at least in part to changes Meta made to its algorithms, which resulted in less news being shown in the home feed of Facebook users. But the UTS and RMIT analysis also shows some publishers changed their approaches to social media in response, focusing on different sources of traffic, such as Google search.</p>

<p>James Meese, one of the RMIT researchers in the 2021 study, says the updated research shows that news on Facebook has continued to underperform on the platform since 2017.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another way to say underperformance is just to say that news on Facebook is dead,&rdquo; he says.</p>
