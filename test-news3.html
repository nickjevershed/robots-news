                        <p>Australia has taken the first steps to nominating parts of Cape York for recognition as Unesco world heritage.</p>

                        <p>The area features 17,000 year-old rock art &ndash; some of the world&rsquo;s largest &ndash; and is home to more than 300 threatened species, including the green sawfish, Cape York rock wallaby and southern cassowary.</p>
                        
                        <p>The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, and Queensland premier, Steven Miles, announced on Thursday they had placed the &ldquo;cultural landscapes&rdquo; of seven national parks on the country&rsquo;s tentative list.</p>
                        
                        <p>It represents sites the Australian government considers to be &ldquo;cultural and/or natural heritage of outstanding universal value and therefore suitable for inscription on the world heritage list.&rdquo; Sites must be on the tentative list for a year before they can be submitted for full listing.</p>
                        
                        <p>&ldquo;This is monumental. It is the first step towards Queensland&rsquo;s incredible Cape York Peninsula being formally recognised on the world heritage list,&rdquo; Miles said.</p>
                        
                        <p>&ldquo;The first time world heritage listing was raised for Cape York was about 42 years ago, when the International Union for the Conservation of Nature said this place is so special, it deserves global recognition,&rdquo; Plibersek said.</p>
                        
                        <p>&ldquo;Traditional owners have known that for thousands of years. There are thousands of years of history and culture here to be protected.&rdquo;</p>
